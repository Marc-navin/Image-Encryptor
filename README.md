# Image-Encryptor
# 🔐 Image Encryptor using Python (Fernet)

This project is a simple yet effective **image encryption and decryption utility** built using Python.  
It ensures **confidentiality and protection** of sensitive image files by encrypting them using the `Fernet` symmetric encryption method from the `cryptography` library.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Encrypt any `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.jpeg` image file
- ✅ Decrypt previously encrypted image files
- ✅ Uses strong AES-based Fernet symmetric encryption
- ✅ Stores encryption key securely in `key1.key`
- ✅ Simple CLI interface (terminal-based)
- ✅ Cross-platform: Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Place** your target image in the same folder as the script
2. **Run** the Python script (`image_encryptor.py`)
3. Choose:
   - `1` → Encrypt the image
   - `2` → Decrypt the image
4. The tool saves:
   - 🔐 `yourimage.jpg.encrypted`
   - 🔓 `yourimage.jpg.encrypted_decrypted.jpg`
